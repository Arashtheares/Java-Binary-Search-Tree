Binary Search Tree (BST) Project

This project demonstrates a simple Binary Search Tree (BST) and how hierarchical data is organised for efficient searching. It includes a full visual diagram showing the tree structure with the root node (50) and its left and right subtrees, helping illustrate parent–child relationships and the overall layout of the data. 

The project also walks through a detailed search example for the value 37, showing the comparison steps taken as the algorithm moves from 50 to 27, then to 34, and finally to 44. This example clearly demonstrates how BST traversal works by directing the search left or right based on the target value. 

Additionally, the project explains how BST deletion is handled using an in-order successor. The removal of node 88 and its replacement with the smallest value in its right subtree show how the BST maintains correct ordering while modifying the tree structure. This provides a practical understanding of how insertions, search operations, and deletions keep the tree functioning properly.
